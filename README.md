# AutomatedRobot
Automated Windows Tool that reoords Keyboard and Mouse events and performs them repeatedly.

It is not a large Application. It is an Java Program that listens keyBoard and Mouse Events 
in a particualr interval as specified by user and repeat the same tasks in required number of times.

I called this pattern myself as MOKE pattern. Its is note a random generated word, It is combination
of MOuse and KEyboard key Listening pattern.

If my english is bad i am sorry and i am really happy in loading first time a project to GITHUB.
